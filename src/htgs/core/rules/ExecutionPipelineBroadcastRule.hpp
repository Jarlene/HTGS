 * When constructing an ExecutionPipeline task, rules must be added to the task to indicate how data is distributed
 * within pipelines. If no rule is specified, then this rule is added automatically during initialization of the task.
 *
 * @tparam T the input/output type for the rule, must be of type IData.
