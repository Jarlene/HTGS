/**
 * @class AnyRuleScheduler AnyRuleScheduler.hpp <htgs/core/rules/AnyRuleScheduler.hpp>
 * @brief Connects a Bookkeeper to another ITask using one IRule.
 * @details
 *
 * Removes the template parameters for the RuleScheduler
 *
 * When data is forwarded to the RuleScheduler from the Bookkeeper, the data is passed to an
 * IRule that is associated with the RuleScheduler. Each IRule is responsible for determining when/if
 * data is ready to be sent to the ITask the RuleScheduler is bound to.
 *
 * The input and output types of each IRule added to a RuleScheduler
 * must match the input and output types of the RuleScheduler.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 * htgs::TaskGraph<htgs::VoidData, htgs::VoidData> *taskGraph = new htgs::TaskGraph<htgs::VoidData, htgs::VoidData>();
 * htgs::Bookkeeper<Data1> *bkTask = new htgs::Bookkeeper<Data1>();
 *
 * // DataRule implements IRule<Data1, Data2> to be compatible with ruleMan
 * DataRule *rule = new DataRule();
 *
 * // The output task for the RuleScheduler with input type Data2
 * Data2ProcessingTask *data2Task = new Data2ProcessingTask();
 *
 * // Creates edge between the Bookkeeper and the Data2ProcessingTask, where rule defines when data is sent
 * taskGraph->addRule(bkTask, data2Task, rule);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam T the input data type for the RuleScheduler, T must derive from IData.
 * @tparam U the output data type for the RuleScheduler, U  must derive from IData.
