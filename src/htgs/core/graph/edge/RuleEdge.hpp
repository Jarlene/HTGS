/**
 * @class RuleEdge RuleEdge.hpp <htgs/core/graph/edge/RuleEdge.hpp>
 * @brief Implements the rule edge that is added to the graph.
 *
 * This edge connects a bookkeeper with some consumer task via a rule. The rule is used to decide
 * when to produce data, often based on the state of the computation.
 *
 * When applying the edge, the bookkeeper and consumer tasks are created. A new rule manager is
 * created to manage the rule. This rule manager is added to the bookkeeper and uses the input
 * connector from the consumer task to produce data.
 *
 * During edge copying the bookkeeper and consumer tasks are copied. The rule is reused. This
 * mechanism shares the rule among multiple bookkeepers, but is acceptable as the rule defines
 * a mutex to ensure no race conditions.
 *
 * @tparam T the input type of the Bookkeeper and IRule
 * @tparam U the output type of the IRule and the input type of the consumer ITask
 * @tparam W the output type of the consumer ITask
