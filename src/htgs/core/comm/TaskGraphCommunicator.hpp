 * @brief Implements the task graph communicator where a task's address and name are mapped to
 * their input connectors.
 *
 * This class's run function is bound to a thread once all task graphs (including sub-graphs), have
 * been built and spawned. Once all threads are active, then a thread is bound to the task graph
 * communicator. All graphs within execution pipelines and the main root graph have a separate
 * task graph communicator, but share the task address mapping.
 *
 * Initially the main graph represents the root of a tree of graphs with branches being defined
 * by execution pipelines. Once all threads and execution pipelines have been created, then the
 * root task graph communicator gathers all addresses and creates the mapping. Once the mapping
 * is complete, then all task graph communicators are bound to separate threads. The mapping is
 * read-only at this point.
 *
 * Each task can submit a data packet into the task graph communicator, which will then send the
 * data directly into the input connector for that data packet's destination.
 *
 *
