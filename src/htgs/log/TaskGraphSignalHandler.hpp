 * @date April 5, 2018
 *
 * @brief Implements a signal handler to catch events such as termination and killing of the process. Once a signal
 * is caught, all task graphs that are registered with the signal handler will be written as a dot file. The dot file
 * is output in the working directory with the name of the signal as a prefix and '-graph-output.dot' as the suffix.
 *
 * @note This class should only be included from main due to the instantiation of a static variable. If this class is
 * included in multiple object files, then there will be linking errors.
