/**
 * @class ITask ITask.hpp <htgs/api/ITask.hpp>
 * @brief An interface to process input data and forward results within a TaskGraph
 * @details
 *
 * To use the ITask, a new class inherits ITask and defines the pure virtual functions. The ITask is
 * then connected into a TaskGraph, which is bound to a Runtime. The ITask contains metadata that describes
 * threading and scheduling rules. Using this metadata, the Runtime spawns threads as a pool. Each thread
 * is bound to a separate instance of the ITask, which is generated through the copy function. 
 *
 * The purpose of this interface is to provide the functions necessary to represent computational and logical operations
 * for algorithms, which are added to a TaskGraph.
 * Custom behavior for an ITask can be implemented, as demonstrated with other classes that derive from ITask; i.e.,
 * Bookkeeper, ExecutionPipeline, and ICudaTask.
 *
 * An ITask should represent some component of an algorithm, such that multiple threads can
 * concurrently process and stream data through a TaskGraph. The main pieces that impact the performance
 * are: (1) Memory requirements, (2) Data dependencies, and (3) Computational complexity.
 *
 * There are two methods for handling memory.
 *
 * The first type of memory for an ITask is local memory. This
 * type should be allocated in the initialize() function and freed in the shutdown() function.
 * It is duplicated (one per thread) and should be local to that thread only.
 *
 * The second type of memory is shared memory, which can be used by other tasks in a TaskGraph. One ITask is responsible
 * for getting memory, while another ITask is responsible for releasing memory.
 * This memory is managed by an external MemoryManager, which allocates the memory, connects the getter
 * and the releaser, and frees the memory once the TaskGraph is finished. Use the TaskGraph::addMemoryManagerEdge
 * to attach shared memory between two ITasks. The memory that is acquired should be incorporated into the
 * output data of the ITask and forwarded until it is released.
 *
 * An ITask can get and release memory using the memGet() and memRelease() routines, respectively. If there are cases where
 * the ITask getting or releasing memory may not a memory edge, then that task can use the hasMemGetter and
 * has memReleaser routines to verify the edge exists.
 *
 * If there are multiple computational ITasks within a TaskGraph, the number of threads processing each ITask
 * should be determined based on the workload of each ITask with the aim of reducing the wait period for every ITask (if possible).
 * By doing so, the overall compute time of a TaskGraph can be evenly distributed. The number of threads in use for computation
 * should not exceed the number of logical cores on a system.
 *
 * There are two types of initialize functions. The basic ITask::initialize(int pipelineId, int numPipelines) is
 * the most commonly used variant. The ITask::initialize(int pipelineId, int numPipeline, TaskScheduler<T, U> *ownerTask,
 * std::shared_ptr<ConnectorVector> pipelineConnectorList) can be used for more advanced operations such as processing data from
 * other execution pipelines using the pipelineConnectorList.
 *
 * Example Implementation:
 * @code
 * class ReadTask : public htgs::ITask<Data1, Data2>
 * {
 *  public:
 *   ReadTask(int numThreads, long memorySize) : ITask(numThreads), memorySize(memorySize) {}
 *
 *   virtual void initialize(int pipelineId, int numPipelines)
 *   {
 *     // This memory will be allocated multiple times (one for each thread that is bound to the ReadTask ITask)
 *     reusableMemory = new double[memorySize];
 *   }
 *
 *   virtual void shutdown() { delete [] reusableMemory; }
 *
 *   virtual void executeTask(std::shared_ptr<Data1> data)
 *   {
 *     ...
 *     // Shared memory getter
 *     std::shared_ptr<htgs::MemoryData<int *>> readBuffer = this->memGet<int *>("readMemory", new ReleaseCountRule(1));
 *     readData(data->getFile(), readBuffer->get());
 *
 *     // Shared memory release example
 *     if (this->hasMemReleaser("otherMemory")
 *     	this->memRelease("otherMemory", data->getMemory());
 *
 *     addResult(new Data2(readBuffer));
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 *   virtual std::string getName() { return "ReadTask"; }
 *
 *   virtual htgs::ITask<Data1, Data2> *copy() { return new ReadTask(this->getNumThreads(), memorySize); }
 *
 *   // Optional. Default will check inputConnector->isInputTerminated();
 *   virtual bool isTerminated(std::shared_ptr<htgs::BaseConnector> inputConnector) { return inputConnector->isInputTerminated(); }
 *
 *  private:
 *   // reusableMemory is not used in computation, but shows an example of local memory allocation
 *   double *reusableMemory;
 *   long memorySize;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * int numThreadsPreprocess = 1;
 * int numThreadsRead = 2;
 * int numThreadsMultiply = 10;
 *
 * htgs::TaskGraph<htgs::VoidData, htgs::VoidData> *taskGraph = new htgs::TaskGraph<htgs::VoidData, htgs::VoidData>();
 *
 * PreProcessTask *preProcTask = new PreProcessTask(numThreadsPreprocess);
 * ReadTask *readTask = new ReadTask(numThreadsRead);
 * MultiplyTask *mulTask = new MultiplyTask(numThreadsMultiply);
 *
 * // Add tasks to task graph (each task must be added before using addMemoryManagerEdge)
 * taskGraph->addEdge(preProcTask, readTask);
 * taskGraph->addEdge(readTask, mulTask);
 *
 * // Add memory edges. The types for the allocator must match the type specified when an ITask uses memGet
 * // Memory pool size is specified based on algorithm scheduling and memory release rules.
 * int otherMemoryPoolSize = 100;
 * int readMemoryPoolSize = 200;
 *
 * // Creates the memory edge "otherMemory" with preProcTask as the getter, and readTask as the releaser
 * taskGraph->addMemoryManagerEdge("otherMemory", preProcTask, readTask, new OtherMemoryAllocator(), otherMemoryPoolSize);
 *
 * // Creates the memory edge "readMemory" with readTask as the getter, and mulTask as the releaser
 * taskGraph->addMemoryManagerEdge("readMemory", readTask, mulTask, new ReadMemoryAllocator(), readMemoryPoolSize);
 *
 * htgs::Runtime *executeGraph = new htgs::Runtime(taskGraph);
 *
 * // Launches threads and binds them to ITasks
 * executeGraph->executeAndWaitForRuntime();
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam T the input data type for the ITask, T must derive from IData.
 * @tparam U the output data type for the ITask, U must derive from IData.
