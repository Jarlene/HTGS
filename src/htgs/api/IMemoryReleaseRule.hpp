/**
 * @class IMemoryReleaseRule IMemoryReleaseRule.hpp <htgs/api/IMemoryReleaseRule.hpp>
 * @brief Abstract class that describes when memory can be released/reused
 *
 * @details
 * This class is used anytime memory is requested by an ITask from a MemoryManager.
 * To receive memory use the function ITask::getMemory
 *
 * IMemoryReleaseRule is attached to the MemoryData. The MemoryData,
 * should be added to IData as data flows through a TaskGraphConf until the memory
 * can be released with ITask::releaseMemory
 *
 * When memory is released, the MemoryManager processes the memory by first updating the
 * state with memoryUsed(), then if canReleaseMemory() returns true, the memory will be recycled.
 *
 * Example Implementation:
 * @code
 * class ReleaseCountRule : public htgs::IMemoryReleaseRule {
 * public:
 * 	ReleaseCountRule(int releaseCount) :
 * 	 releaseCount(releaseCount) {}
 *
 * 	virtual void memoryUsed() { releaseCount--; }
 *
 * 	virtual bool canReleaseMemory() { return releaseCount == 0; }
 *
 * private:
 *  int releaseCount;
 *
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 * class SampleTask : public ITask<Data1, Data2>
 * {
 *   ...
 *
 *   void executeTask(std::shared_ptr<Data1> data)
 *   {
 *     ...
 *     // Get memory from "memEdge" MemoryManager, and attach the ReleaseCount rule to the memory
 *     htgs::m_data_t<double> mem = this->memGet<double>("memEdge", new ReleaseCountRule(4));
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     // Store the memory data to be passed along task graph
 *     addResult(new Data2(mem));
 *   }
 *   ...
 * };
 *
 * @endcode
 *
